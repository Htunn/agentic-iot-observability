# Security Policy

## Security Overview

This project implements several security measures to ensure a secure deployment:

### Container Security
- All Docker containers run as non-root users
- Read-only filesystem mounts where possible
- Limited container capabilities
- Resource limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Container health checks for monitoring

### Network Security
- Internal services are not exposed directly to the internet
- MongoDB is only accessible within the Docker network
- API endpoints are protected with rate limiting
- Services use strict CORS settings

### Data Security
- No sensitive data is stored in the project code
- Environment variables are used for configuration
- MongoDB authentication should be enabled in production

### Code Security
- Dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- Security headers are configured in the services
- Input validation on all API endpoints

## Production Considerations

Before deploying this project to production, consider the following:

1. **Update Default Credentials**: 
   - Change default Grafana admin credentials
   - Configure proper MongoDB authentication
   - Use strong, unique passwords

2. **Enable HTTPS**:
   - Add a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Traefik) with SSL/TLS
   - Configure proper SSL certificates
   - Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

3. **Add Authentication**:
   - Implement proper authentication for the API services
   - Consider using OAuth or API keys

4. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Monitor security advisories for used components

5. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Monitor resource usage and access patterns

By following these guidelines, you can maintain a secure deployment of this IoT observability project.
